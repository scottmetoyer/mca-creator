<h1>Station</h1>
<p>Deep in the ink black stillness of space looms a silent, derelict craft.</p>
<p>The V-Class scientific research station Lucene has been lost to human contact for over 50 years. Her last messages were a garbled, chaotic mess of static and noise - then, silence. She disappeared from known space, her whereabouts a mystery.</p>
<p>Adventurers, treasure hunters, and deep-space salvagers have been searching for her ever since.</p>
